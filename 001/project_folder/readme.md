#Samscom Example Page

This repo is for the Rosetta Web Exercise involving an example product discovery page that is both responsive and uses app-like navigation features in order to enhance the user experience.

###Notes
The basis of this application is based on [init](https://github.com/picanteverde/init) by Picante Verde

###Project Difficulties:

####Not designing mobile first.

If I could do this project again, I would design the mobile side of things first and scale up. It's a guideline that I forgot to follow.

####Overly ambitious goals

I went into this project knowing very little about Marionette, JST, RequireJS, or LESS (chosen because Bootstrap also uses LESS). It was my attempt to learn all of these things while creating this project. I probably spread myself too thin.

####Time

Time was not on my side for this. I had a four day weekend to Arizona planned with family during this test. I was under the impression I would finish this assignment before then, but I ended up running up right to the final hour with this. Lacking dedicated time and not having an established work station make this assignment much more difficult!

###Known Issues

1) The desktop version does not center beyond 1527px
2) The page backgrounds do not slide away
3) The fade in and up animations are lacking on all of the zones except the default desktop page.
