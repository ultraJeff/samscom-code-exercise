#Samscom Example Page

This repo is for the Rosetta Web Exercise involving an example product discovery page that is both responsive and uses app-like navigation features in order to enhance the user experience.

###Notes
The basis of this application is based on [init](https://github.com/picanteverde/init) by Picante Verde

###Project Difficulties:

####Not designing mobile first.

If I could do this project again, I would design the mobile side of things first and scale up. It's a guideline that I forgot to follow.

####Overly ambitious goals

I went into this project knowing very little about Marionette, JST, or LESS (chosen because Bootstrap also uses LESS). It was my attempt to learn all of these things while creating this project. I see that I spread myself too thin for timed test!

####Time

When it rains it pours. I had a four day family vacation planned this weekend. I was under the impression I would finish this assignment before then, but without an established work station, the assignment becomes much more difficult to develop.
